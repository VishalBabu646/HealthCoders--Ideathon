ChatDoctor is an innovative AI doctor model built on the LLaMA framework. Its primary aim is to offer patients a smart and dependable healthcare companion capable of addressing their medical questions and providing tailored medical advice.

This advanced language model is specifically crafted for medical use. It has been trained on an extensive collection of medical literature, giving it a comprehensive understanding of medical terms, procedures, and diagnoses. ChatDoctor leverages this foundation to evaluate patients' symptoms and medical histories, deliver precise diagnoses, and recommend suitable treatment options.

ChatDoctor is designed to mimic a conversation between a doctor and a patient, utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. Patients can engage with ChatDoctor through a chat interface, posing questions about their health, symptoms, or medical conditions. The model then processes the input and offers a response customized to the patient's specific situation.

A standout feature of ChatDoctor is its capacity to learn and adapt over time. As more patients interact with the model, it continually refines its responses and enhances its accuracy. Consequently, patients can anticipate receiving progressively more personalized and precise medical advice.

Our project make use of the chatgpt API and medical dataset from various free sites such as HealthCaremagic and various others including wikipedia to train our model .If we give prompts such as symptoms it will respond with the diagnosis of the disease and possible mediacation and treatment plans.
To run our project in a local machine ,install the required dependencies and framework using the requirements.txt file using the following command

pip install -r requirements.txt

Now run the chat.py file in our project to start chat.

Thanking you
